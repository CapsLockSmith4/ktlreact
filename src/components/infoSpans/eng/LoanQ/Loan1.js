            <br/>
            <p>A loan is where you borrow money, most likely from a bank or other financial 
                institution, and agree to pay the amount back over a certain time. There is 
                usually an amount of interest charged in addition to the amount borrowed. 
                It is best to get financial advice before entering into any type of loan to 
                make sure you understand all of the terms and conditions. You should consider 
                the following questions before getting a loan:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Do I need a Loan?</li>
                <li>Do I have a stable job?</li>
                <li>Do I have regular income?</li>
                <li>What other expenses do I have to consider?</li>
                <li>Can I afford the repayments on the loan?</li>
                <li>Will I be able to keep up with the repayments if my work situation changes?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Financial Rights Legal Centre provides further information that you should read before 
                you borrow money, or advice on what to do if you are <a href= 'https://financialrights.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/FRLC-Factsheet-Cant-Pay-Loan.pdf'>struggling to pay your loan.</a></p>
