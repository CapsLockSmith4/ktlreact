			<p class="subtitle">Credit Card Debt</p>
			<p class="content">A credit card allows you to purchase things now and pay for them at a later time. It is important to avoid credit card debt as you are charged interest on your purchases. It is very easy to overspend or exceed the limit on your credit card if you don’t keep a careful track of your expenses. You should aim to at least make the minimum repayment on any or all credit cards you have each month. If you cannot make the minimum repayment you should pay off whatever you can and then speak with your credit card provider about any possible repayment arrangements. The Financial Rights Legal Centre provides the following factsheet relating to <a target="_blank" href="http://financialrights.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/FRLC-Factsheet-Drowning-Credit-Cards1.pdf">credit card debt.</a></p>

			<p class="subtitle">Phone Debt</p>
			<p class="content">If you do not have a stable job, have little to no income or you have significant debt, it is not advisable to enter into a phone plan contract. Pre-paid mobile phones are available where you pre-pay a certain amount of 'credit' for your phone without having a contract. If you are struggling to pay your phone debt consult the Financial Rights Legal Centre factsheet on <a class="ng-scope" href="http://financialrights.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/FRLC-Factsheet-Cant-Pay-Phone.pdf">phone debt</a></p>

			<p class="subtitle">Utility Debt – Electricity, Gas &amp; Water Bills</p>
			<p class="content">If you find yourself in debt to a utility company you should contact the company and try to negotiate a repayment arrangement. Also inform the company that you are suffering financial hardship and ask that they don’t disconnect your services.
